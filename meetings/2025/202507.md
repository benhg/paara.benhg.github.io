**ToADS HF**: A Layer Cake of Protocols That Nobody Ordered

Why send text over HF the easy way when you could bake a layer cake of protocols no one asked for?
ToADS HF (Text Over Audio-Digital-Sideband over HF) is a work-in-progress mode that combines GGWave modulation, RTTY-over-audio, and a CAT-controlled HF setup to reinvent the wheel (with extra layers). In this talk, Ben Glick KN6UBF explores how this unnecessarily inelegant stack works, why it’s fun, and what it says about ham radio’s enduring love of solving simple problems the hard way. It’s a celebration of signal path absurdity, protocol cosplay, and the kind of engineering hobbyists do for no other reason than because we can.
